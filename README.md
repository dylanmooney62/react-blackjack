## Assumptions

When developing the game the following assumptions were made:

- The player always chooses the highest valid value. Meaning an ACE equals 11 unless it causes a bust.
- The dealer always hits on a total of 16 or less. 
- The dealer will stand on soft 17 (E.g., 6 + Ace).
- The dealer plays out turn even if the player has bust.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
